JavaScript Project: Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)/ Also this will be an application with automated end-to-end (E2E) tests using Playwright. Playwright is a powerful framework for browser automation, ideal for testing web applications across multiple browsers.
This project demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using JavaScript. The goal is to showcase how to work with classes, objects, inheritance, and other OOP principles within a JavaScript application.

Features
Js Basic: Java script intro.
Classes: Defining blueprints for creating objects.
Encapsulation: Using getters and setters to manage object properties.
Inheritance: Creating subclasses that inherit from parent classes.
Polymorphism: Overriding methods in child classes.
Playwright for end-to-end testing: Write tests in JavaScript/TypeScript that run in multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
Automatic browser launching and testing: Runs the tests in headless mode by default, but can also run in headful mode for debugging.
Parallel test execution: Tests can be run in parallel for faster execution.
This project will help you understand how JavaScript implements OOP concepts and how to use them effectively in your applications.
